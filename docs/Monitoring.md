In a production environment, I would ensure robust monitoring and logging to track failures, error rates, and throughput effectively.

1.    Error Logging: I would use structured logging with libraries like Python's logging module to capture key events, exceptions, and errors throughout the pipeline (e.g., during file downloads, metadata extraction, and database updates). Logs would be stored in a centralized system such as AWS CloudWatch to allow for easy querying and analysis.

2.    Error Rate Monitoring: I would configure CloudWatch Metrics to track the number of failed tasks (such as download errors or failed DICOM parsing). If the error rate exceeds a certain threshold, an alert would be triggered using CloudWatch Alarms or integrated with tools like PagerDuty for real-time notifications.

3.    Throughput Monitoring: To track processing efficiency, I would monitor key performance metrics like the number of DICOM files processed per minute or throughput of metadata extraction using CloudWatch Logs or Prometheus. A tool like Grafana can be used to create visual dashboards that provide real-time insights into pipeline throughput.

4.    Retry Mechanisms: For transient failures (like network issues or temporary file access problems), I would implement a retry mechanism with exponential backoff, which would automatically retry failed operations without overwhelming the system.

5.    Alerting: I would set up alerts to notify the team about critical issues such as database connection failures or unexpected file corruptions. These alerts would be routed through Slack, Sentry etc.
