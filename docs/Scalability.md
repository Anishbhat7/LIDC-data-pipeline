To handle 1,000+ scans efficiently, I would modify the pipeline by leveraging parallel processing for tasks like downloading DICOM files and extracting metadata. This could be achieved using concurrent.futures or multiprocessing to process multiple files simultaneously, significantly speeding up the pipeline. For large volumes of data, I would switch to cloud-based storage like AWS S3 for scalable, distributed file storage and Amazon RDS or DynamoDB for metadata storage, ensuring seamless scaling. To further optimize performance, I would use AWS Lambda for serverless execution of independent tasks (e.g., DICOM file processing) and Step Functions to orchestrate the workflow in a distributed, fault-tolerant manner. Additionally, batch processing and error handling with retries and logging would ensure robustness for large-scale operations.
